           <span class="underlined-text"><b>T</b>wo households, both alike in dignity,</span><br> 
            In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br><br>

            <i>
            <span class="underlined-text"><strong>F</strong>rom forth the fatal loins of these two foes</span> <br>
            A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
            Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br> <br>

            <u><span class="bold-big-letter">T</span>he fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</u> <br>
            And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
            Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
            Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
            The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
